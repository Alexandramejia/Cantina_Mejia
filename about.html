        <h2>About Cantina del Axolotl</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Cantina del Axolotl</strong>, where the spirit of Mexico lives in every dish, every color, and every corner. Our story began with a simple dream — to create a place where people could gather, laugh, and enjoy soulful, flavorful food inspired by the heart of Mexican tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we didn’t want just any name. We wanted a symbol — something meaningful, playful, and deeply rooted in our culture. That’s when we found the axolotl.
        </p>
        <p>
          Native only to the ancient lakes of Xochimilco and Chalco in central Mexico, the axolotl is a rare and fascinating creature. Unlike most amphibians, it never undergoes full metamorphosis, keeping its youthful, smiley face for life. To us, that represents exactly what we want our cantina to feel like: forever young, curious, and full of joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Aztec mythology, the axolotl is tied to the god <strong>Xolotl</strong>, guardian of the underworld and twin of Quetzalcoatl. The legend says Xolotl took the form of an axolotl to avoid being sacrificed, hiding in the waters of Lake Xochimilco. In that same spirit of transformation and survival, our cantina blends the old and the new — traditional recipes passed down through generations, served in a space that feels alive and playful.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Cantina del Axolotl, you’ll find more than tacos and tamales. You’ll discover stories, culture, and a piece of Mexico that’s proud, flavorful, and always welcoming.
